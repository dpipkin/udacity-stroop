## The Science of Decisions
Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program created this project as an assessment of basic knowledge of Statistics.
### Background Information
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the <i>color of the ink</i> in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the <i>congruent words</i> condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style="color:red">RED</span>, <span style="color:blue">BLUE</span>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style="color:green">PURPLE</span>, <span style="color:purple">ORANGE</span>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.
